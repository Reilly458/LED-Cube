# LED-Cube

##Goal: 

Build a 4x4x4 RGB LED cube that is sound responsive. I will program the colours and the patterns to be associated with specific music note frequencies, i.e. G is green C is red etc., and volume will be associated with LED intensity and lighting pattern. 


##Tasks:

- [x] Build 4x4x4 RGB LED cube
- [x] Test LED connections with 5V source and 220Ohm resist
- [ ] Order microphone and spectrum analyser break out board to do some testing to better understand how the chip works for determining how to associate frequenies; may need to design my own version with filters to isolate the specific music frequencies
- [ ] Find components capable of measuring decibles for volume association
- [ ] Design and build circuity to be run with an Arduino microcontroller
- [ ] Design to run with wall power and batteries
- [ ] Write code for LED control
- [ ] Implement multiple modes
